# Bankruptcy-Prediction-Using-Financial-Ratios-and-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting corporate bankruptcy using financial ratios and machine learning techniques. We processed data for ~7,400 companies and engineered features such as profit margin, ROA, and liability ratios. Multiple algorithms were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with Decision Tree and Random Forest showing better recall. The goal was to improve bankrupt company detection using recall-focused metrics. The project was built using Python, scikit-learn, and XGBoost, and includes detailed EDA, modeling, and evaluation steps.
